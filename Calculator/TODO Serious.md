# What did you learn today?

-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Making Backups when creating new Versions of your Code
        -- It is improtant because if you mess up really badly, you always can jump back to a Version where everything actually works.

- There is no doubt in my head. AI-Tools are the future when it comes to programming, if it wouldn't be with the help of ChatGPT I wouldn't be able to make such rapid progressions in overall quality for a calculator. 

- But I don't like the idea of over reliance. I would be wise to learn by myself, knowing what snippets of code actually does what! So (if currently for the 2023 standard.) The somewhat limited AI hits a roadblock I can do the stuff on my own or if for some reason the Internet-connection fails (extremly rare). I can work on my own and still get most of my time.
